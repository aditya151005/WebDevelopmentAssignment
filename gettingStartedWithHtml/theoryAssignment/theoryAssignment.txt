4. Write a short note on Tag and element with an example.

Ans– HTML tags are the keywords on a web page that define how our web browser must format and display our web page. 

Almost all tags contain two parts, an opening, and a closing tag. For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag.

Basic HTML Tags

HTML Tag

The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document. The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements .

Head Tag
The head tag <head> contains all the elements describing the document. 

Title Tag
The title tag <title> specifies the HTML page title, which is shown in the browser’s title bar. 

Body Tag
The body tag <body> is where we insert our web page’s content. 

Paragraph Tag
A paragraph tag <p> is used to define a paragraph on a web page.

Heading Tag 
The HTML heading tag is used to define the heading of the HTML document. The <h1> tag defines the most important tag, and <h6> defines  the least.

Formatting Tags

Emphasis tag
The HTML <em> tag is used to emphasize the particular text in a paragraph.

Bold Tag
The <b> tag is used to make the text bold.

Italic Tag
The <i> tag is used to make the text italic.

Underline Tag
The <u> tag is used to set the text underline.

Link Tag
The <a> tag links one page to another page. The href attribute is used to specify the URL of the page that the link goes to.

List Tag
The <li> tag is used if we want to enter the contents in the listed order. There are two types of lists.
Ordered list <ol>
Unordered list <ul>

Image Tag
The <img> tag  is used to embed an image in an HTML document. We need to specify the source of the image inside the tag.

The Table Tag
The <table> tag is used to create a table in the HTML document.
The table row (<tr>) tag is used to make the rows in the table, and the table data (<td>) tag is used to enter the data in the table.

5.What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?
Ans -  
The HTML doctype is used to instruct the browser that the following document is an HTML document.
It is called as the document type declaration (DTD).
Technically <!DOCTYPE > is not a tag/element, it is just an instruction to the browser about the document type. 
It is a null element which does not contain the closing tag, and must not include any content within it.

<!DOCTYPE html> represents HTML5.

It is case insensitive, it can be written as <!Doctype HTML>, <!DOCTYPE html> etc. 
It should be placed on the top of the HTML document.
