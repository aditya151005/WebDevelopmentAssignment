    <h1>This is a web design page.</h1> 
    <p>Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for designing a website in a way that is functional and offers a good user experience. User experience is central to the web designing process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways that make them easy to navigate. Web designing essentially involves working on every attribute of the website that people interact with, so that the website is simple and efficient, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and looks visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how well the website is designed.<br>
    Web designers create the design and layout of a website with their technical expertise and knowledge while keeping in mind the client's requirements. They have a deep understanding of UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) and are adept at using design programs for creating visual elements. <br>
    Key Benefits of Having a Good Web Design- <br>
    An Impactful First Impression, Better Google Rankings, Brand Consistency, Minimized Bounce Rates. <br>
    Key Elements of Web Design - <br>
    Visual Elements(Fonts,
    Colors,
    Shapes,
    Layout,
    Icons,
    Logos,
    Images,
    Video) <br>
    Functional Elements(Navigation, User interaction, Speed, Site structure, Cross-device compatibility) <br>
    Web design is more about the experiential side of a website that ensures the audience finds the website useful, immersive, and engaging. <br>
    Web development, on the other hand, involves building and maintaining a website with the help of coding systems so that the website functions smoothly with no glitches.
