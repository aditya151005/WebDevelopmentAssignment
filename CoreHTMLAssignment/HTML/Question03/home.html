    <h1>This is a home page.</h1>  
    <p>A home page is the default or front page of a site. It is the first page that visitors see when they load a URL. Web managers can control the home page as a way of directing the user experience. Most web servers allow the home page to have one of several different file names that exist, such as index.html, index.htm, index.shtml, index.php, default.html or home.html. This default file name of the main page can be customized. 
    <br>
    There is no standard layout for the homepage, but most main pages include a navigation bar that offers links to different sections of the website. Other common elements found on a homepage are the search bar, information about the website, and recent news or updates. Some websites include information that changes every day.
    When performing an internet search, it is usual the first link that appears is from the home page, so it is usually the landing page that attracts the attention of visitors. A good homepage should provide links so that the rest of the website is navigable, being advisable to include a search box to speed up the user experience.</p>
