Why to create accessible websites- 

Inclusivity for People with Disabilities -
Accessible web development practices open up new possibilities for individuals with disabilities, allowing them to access information, make purchases, and connect with others online. It promotes independence and inclusion, breaking down barriers that hinder their participation in the digital world.
Enhanced User Experience-

By considering accessibility from the early stages of development, web designers can create user-friendly interfaces that cater to a wider audience.
Legal and Ethical Considerations-
Ensuring web accessibility is not only a moral obligation but also a legal requirement in many countries. Non-compliance with accessibility standards can lead to legal consequences and damage an organization's reputation. By prioritizing accessibility, businesses demonstrate their commitment to inclusivity and social responsibility.

Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:
people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
older people with changing abilities due to ageing.
people with "temporary disabilities" such as a broken arm or lost glasses.
people with "situational limitations" such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio.
people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth.
There is also a strong business case for accessibility.
Accessibility can enhance our brand, drive innovation, and extend our market reach.
