      <h3>Poppins</h3>
      <img src="/HTML/Images/Poppins Font.png" alt="poppinsFontImage" />
      <p>
        Poppins is a geometric sans-serif typeface published by Indian Type
        Foundry in 2014. It was released as open-source and is available for
        free on Google Fonts. Indian Type Foundry describes Poppins as "an
        internationalist take on the geometric sans genre."It supports both
        Latin and Devanagari languages and is available in nine weights with
        matching italics.

      <h3>Roboto</h3>
      <img src="/HTML/Images/RobotoFont.jpg" alt="RobotoFontImage" />
      <p>
        Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
        largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
        curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid
        rhythm, Roboto doesn't compromise, allowing letters to be settled into
        their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more
        commonly found in humanist and serif types. This is the regular family,
        which can be used alongside the Roboto Condensed family and the Roboto
        Slab family.

      <h3>Arvo</h3>
      <img src="/HTML/Images/ArvoFont.jpg" alt="ArvoFontImage" />
      <p>
        Arvo is a geometric slab-serif typeface family suited for screen and
        print. The family includes 4 cuts: Roman, Italic, Roman Bold, Bold
        Italic. It is a libre font, first published in Google Fonts. The flavour
        of the font is rather mixed. It's monolinear-ish, but has a tiny bit of
        contrast (which increases the legibility a little in Mac OS X.) The name
        Arvo is a typical Estonian man's name, but is not widely used today. In
        the Finnish language, Arvo means "number, value, worth." Considering how
        much programming is involved in hinting, all these meanings are true. In
        December 2013 Arvo 2.0.1 was released, with support for languages that
        use the Cyrillic script, the latin script is expanded to Adobe's Glyph
        List 3, and many truetype hints are improved especially for in smaller
        sizes (regular cuts start now from 9ppem). Also added PANOSE
        classification numbers, cleaned up character palette order, and many
        more smaller bug fixes were made.

      <h3>Playfair</h3>
      <img src="/HTML/Images/playfairFont.png" alt="playfairFontImage" />
      <p>
        Playfair is a transitional design. In the European Enlightenment in the
        late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens
        as the popular writing tool of the day. Together with developments in
        printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became to print
        letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were
        increasingly detached from the written letterforms. This design lends
        itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular
        design, it takes influence from the designs of John Baskerville and from
        'Scotch Roman' designs. Being a Display (large size) design in the
        transitional genre, functionally and stylistically it can accompany
        Georgia for body text.

      <h3>Yellowtail</h3>
      <img src="/HTML/Images/YellowtailFont.com" alt="YellowtailFontImage" />
      <p>
        Yellowtail is an old school flavored flat brush script typeface of
        medium weight. It's mix of connecting and non-connecting letterforms
        lend to its unique look and legibility. Yellowtail nods to classic
        1930's typestyles like Gillies Gothic & Kaufmann, yet has the loose
        visual cadence of sign painter scripts.

      <h3>Cedarville Cursive</h3>
      <img
        src="/HTML/Images/CedarvilleCursive Font.png"
        alt="CedarvilleCursiveFontImage"
      />
      <p>
        Cederville Cursive is based on the handwriting of a cheerful young
        preschool teacher. From her love of her Cedarville University alma mater
        to her passion for her students, she is a delightful, dependable person.
        Her handwriting contains that same blend of fun appeal with restrained
        discipline. Many handwritten script fonts have large flourishes, but
        this is a more simple script, similar to authentic daily handwriting.

      <h3>Merriweather</h3>
      <img src="/HTML/Images/MerriweatherFont.png" alt="MerriweatherFontImage" />
      <p>
        Merriweather was designed to be a text face that is pleasant to read on
        screens. It features a very large x height, slightly condensed
        letterforms, a mild diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open forms. There
        is also Merriweather Sans, a sans-serif version which closely harmonizes
        with the weights and styles of this serif family. The Merriweather
        project is led by Sorkin Type, a type design foundry based in Western
        Massachaussets, USA. To contribute, see

      <h3>Alegreya</h3>
      <img src="/HTML/Images/AlegreyaFont.png" alt="AlegreyaFontImage" />
      <p>
        Alegreya was chosen as one of 53 "Fonts of the Decade" at the ATypI
        Letter2 competition in September 2011, and one of the top 14 text type
        systems. It was also selected in the 2nd Bienal Iberoamericana de
        Dise√±o, competition held in Madrid in 2010. Alegreya is a typeface
        originally intended for literature. Among its crowning characteristics,
        it conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm which facilitates the reading of
        long texts. Also, it provides freshness to the page while referring to
        the calligraphic letter, not as a literal interpretation, but rather in
        a contemporary typographic language.

      <h3>Open Sans</h3>
      <img src="/HTML/Images/OpenSansFont.jpg" alt="OpenSansFontImage" />
      <p>
        Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson,
        Type Director of Ascender Corp. This version contains the complete 897
        character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek
        and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was designed with an upright
        stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. It was
        optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent
        legibility characteristics in its letterforms. In March 2021, the family
        has been updated to a variable font family and it also includes Hebrew,
        and unified and simplified the licensing under OFL.

      <h3>Libre Franklin</h3>
      <img src="/HTML/Images/LibreFranklin.jpg" alt="LibreFranklinFontImage" />
      <p>
        Libre Franklin is a modern and versatile web font that brings classic
        American typeface aesthetics to the internet. It's a common choice for
        multilingual websites because it supports both Latin-based languages and
        non-Latin languages like Greek, Cyrillic, and Arabic.

      <h3>Raleway</h3>
      <img src="/HTML/Images/RalewayFont.png" alt="RalewayFontImage" />
      <p>
        Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed by
        Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight
        family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by
        Igino Marini. A thorough review and italic was added in 2016. It is a
        display face and the download features both old style and lining
        numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of
        diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric
        sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character
        set.

      <h3>Inter</h3>
      <img src="/HTML/Images/InterFont.png" alt="InterFontImage" />
      <p>
        Inter is a variable font family carefully crafted & designed for
        computer screens. Inter features a tall x-height to aid in readability
        of mixed-case and lower-case text. Several OpenType features are
        provided as well, like contextual alternates that adjusts punctuation
        depending on the shape of surrounding glyphs, slashed zero for when you
        need to disambiguate "0" from "o", tabular numbers, etc.

      <h3>Lora</h3>
      <img src="/HTML/Images/loraFont.jpg" alt="loraFontImage" />
      <p>
        Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It
        is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text. A
        paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its
        brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs. The overall typographic
        voice of Lora perfectly conveys the mood of a modern-day story, or an
        art essay. Technically Lora is optimised for screen appearance, and
        works equally well in print. In March 2019, the family has been updated
        to a variable font family.
